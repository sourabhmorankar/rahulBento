# Project Codebase: /Users/abcom/WebstormProjects/rahulBento

# Core Directives:

## Initial Conversation Setup: Upon receiving the user's first prompt in any new conversation:
1. Thoroughly review PROJECT.MD to grasp the project's objectives.
2. Analyze the entire current codebase within the project directory. Read every line of relevant files to understand current progress and functionality.
3. Examine TODO.MD for the current task status.
4. Consult TIMECAPSULE.MD for knowledge and instructions from prior conversations.
Only after completing these steps, address the user's query.

## Comprehensive File Analysis
When reading any file, process its entire content from start to finish, ensuring a complete understanding of its purpose and functionality, even if this requires multiple reads.

## External Information Retrieval 
If necessary to resolve a user request or if facing difficulties, utilize internet searches for relevant data.

## Prioritize Editing 
Whenever feasible and more efficient, edit existing code rather than writing new code from scratch.

## No Code Comments 
Never include comments in any code you generate or provide.

## Concise Explanations
Keep all explanations brief and to the point.

## End-Response Updates: 
After each response:
1. Update TODO.MD reflecting the tasks completed.
2. Update TIMECAPSULE.MD with essential knowledge from the current conversation for your future reference in subsequent, separate conversations.

## Verification: 
After finishing each phase, verify the functionality and efficiecy of the codebase with the updates you have done. Also check the preview using Puppeteer MCP and ask user if there should be any changes or updates that the user would want to do before proceeding to the next phase. 

## Token Limit Management (200k):
- Constantly monitor token usage. Before executing any task, estimate the response length.
- Proceed with execution only if the task can be completed within the 200k token limit. If not then inform the user that you will be doing only a part of the request annd do it partially.
- If the token count approaches 180k during a conversation, halt current processing and immediately update TIMECAPSULE.MD with the pertinent context and status.
